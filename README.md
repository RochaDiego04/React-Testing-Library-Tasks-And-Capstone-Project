# React Testing Library Course

Welcome to the **React Testing Library Course** repository! This repository is designed to help you build a solid foundation in testing React components using React Testing Library.

## Course Overview

This repository consists of two main sections:

### 1. **Course Tasks**

In the `Course-Tasks` folder, you will find three tasks aimed at building your skills step by step, after you finish tasks send proof of completion for all tasks with test coverage(you need 100% to pass)

### Task 1: Testing a Todo List Component

**Description**: Write tests using various selectors and queries (`getBy`, `queryBy`, `findBy`, etc.) to interact with a simple Todo List component. Additionally, use `screen.debug()` to inspect the DOM during testing.

### Task 2: Simulating User Interactions

**Description**: Write tests that simulate various user interactions, such as button clicks, form input changes, and mouse events, verifying that the component's state and behavior update correctly.

### Task 3: Testing Authentication Flow

**Description**: Write tests for a login component to verify user authentication, including input handling, API calls, and redirects. Additionally, test a protected component to ensure proper redirection for unauthenticated users.

Each task includes detailed instructions and examples to guide you through the process of writing tests for React components.

### 2. **Capstone Project**

In the `Capstone-React-Testing-Library` folder, you will find the **Capstone Project**. This project is a comprehensive, real-world example designed to test your understanding of the concepts you've learned throughout the course. The capstone project will require you to apply all the testing techniques and best practices covered in the tasks.
